## About the Project

Since moving back from my teaching stint in South Korea, I knew it was time to find a career stateside that I would truly love. Though my interests are numerous ranging from bouldering to gardening, my passion for making things and my love for technology seemed to be a solid crossroads to build a career; a career in software development. I have messed around with web development projects using vanilla JS in the past, and my closet is full of various Arduino and Raspberry Pi contraptions. However, pursuing software development as a full-time gig is a relatively recent endeavor.

This Caesar cipher is my first legitimate program, which I made halfway through The Complete Python Programmer Bootcamp 2020 course on Udemy.

## How it Works

I went through several steps to complete this program.

1. I brainstormed the functions the app would provide: encrypting a message, exporting an encrypted file and key, inputting the file and key, decrypting the message.

2. I made a roadmap (this is the updated roadmap, the original used a dictionary instead of a list).

3. I wrote out how the application would work in pseudocode.

4. I wrote my program in Spyder 3.

5. **Hours upon hours of debugging.**

6. Success!

## What I Learned

This was a *huge* project for me. I think, from start to finish, I spend 18 hours collectively over a two day period completing this project. 

I had two main goals in doing this project:

I wanted to see if programming was an all over positive experience for me. 
I wanted to write the code myself, and understand the logic behind everything I was writing.

I can certainly say that I accomplished both of my goals with this project. The experience as a whole was a rewarding one. Although there were times that I got insanely frustrated when my code was throwing errors, I was able to take a breather and come back with a different perspective.

For example, I originally wanted to pull values with unknown key pairs from a dictionary and copy those values to a new list. However, after failing numerous times and spending hours searching the forums to no avail, I decided to go with a different approach. Instead, I was able to use the enumerate() function to pull the index numbers of a master list. That way I could match the value of my list with the corresponding value on a master list and copy the index number instead! It worked perfectly.

Halfway through my project, I learned from the bountiful online community the true personality of what Python code should be; it should be Pythonic. This caused me to delve deep into the hole of list, set and dictionary comprehension. Although my Caesar cipher isnâ€™t very Pythonic, I am very content with the project as a whole. Instead of going back and rewriting my program to be more Python, I will instead make that the focus of my next project.
